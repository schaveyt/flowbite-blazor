# Flowbite React to Blazor Migration Project Plan

## Project Understanding

This project involves converting the Flowbite React component library to ASP.NET Blazor 8.0.

### Current Setup

#### Source Project (Flowbite React)

- Location: C:/Users/tschavey/projects/flowbite-react
- Comprehensive React component library
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Components in packages/ui/src/components
- Storybook for documentation
- TypeScript implementation

#### Target Project (Blazor)

- Solution: FlowbiteBlazorDesktop.sln
- Component Library: src/Flowbite/src/Flowbite/
- Demo App: src/AppServer (Blazor Web Server)
- Render Modes: Server and InteractiveServer only
- Git submodule for component isolation

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Component Translation

- React's JSX to Razor syntax conversion
- Event handling differences
- Component lifecycle mapping
- State management adaptation

### 2. Blazor-Specific Features

- Parameters vs Props
- Two-way binding (@bind)
- Cascading parameters
- JavaScript interop when needed

### 3. Styling

- TailwindCSS integration
- CSS isolation consideration
- Dark mode implementation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup Phase

- [x] Configure .clinerules for consistent development
- [x] Set up TailwindCSS in Blazor project
- Create component development workflow
- Establish testing strategy

### 2. Component Migration Strategy

- User demo pages to test components in isolation
- Start with foundational components
- Create base component classes
- Implement shared utilities
- Develop component-specific tests

### 3. Implementation Order

A demo page for each component is created with url `/demo/components/{component-name}` and
file location `src/AppServer/Components/Pages/{component-name}Demo.razor`.
The demo page is used to test the component in isolation.

#### a. Core Components

- [x] Button (completed with link support and icon integration)
- [x] Alert (completed with icon support and content flexibility)
- Icons (in progress - refining implementation)
- Card
- Modal

#### b. Form Components

- Input
- Select
- Checkbox

#### c. Navigation Components

- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Tabs

#### d. Advanced Components

- Datepicker
- Dropdown
- Table

### 4. Documentation

- Component API documentation
- Usage examples
- Migration guides
- Best practices

### 5. Testing & Validation

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility testing

### 6. Optimization

- Performance tuning
- Bundle size optimization
- Server-side rendering
- Progressive enhancement

## Next Steps

1. Refine Icon system implementation
2. Create comprehensive icon library
3. Document icon usage patterns
4. Continue with core components migration
5. Establish documentation standards

## Notes

This is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and systematic execution. The modular approach will allow for incremental progress while maintaining quality and consistency.

Recent Improvements:

- Button component completed with link functionality and icon integration
- Alert component completed with flexible content options and icon support
- Established IconBase system for consistent icon handling
- Created comprehensive demo pages with examples
- Implemented DynamicComponent rendering for better component integration

Regular reviews and adjustments to this plan may be necessary as we progress through the implementation.
